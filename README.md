### Engineering Principles <a href="#general-guidance" id="general-guidance"></a>

* Keep the code quality bar high.
* Reusable services as engineering products.
* Make the simple thing work now. Build fewer features today, but ensure they work amazingly. Then add more features tomorrow.
* Avoid adding scope to a backlog item, instead add a new backlog item.
