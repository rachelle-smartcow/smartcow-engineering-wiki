### Engineering Principles <a href="#general-guidance" id="general-guidance"></a>

We continuously strive to apply the following engineering principles in the way we develop our services and digital products.

* Keep it simple - don't over engineer.
* Don't repeat yourself - avoid copy-pasting the same code in multiple places.
* Occam's Razor - build MVP and add more functionalities after.&#x20;
* Big design upfront - create your flow before implementing code.&#x20;
* Law of Demeter - reduce number of connections between entities, associated entities must be in same directory.&#x20;

**“Keeping things simple is always the best approach.”**
